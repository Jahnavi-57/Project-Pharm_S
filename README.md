# Project-Pharm_S
- This is my first project and it is "Project Pharm_S"
- It is an application that's gonna be useful for Pharmaceutical Stores for the organization of all types of medicines, their costs, details of customers purchasing them etc.
- We have used mysql database as backend where all the data related to this application gets stored and the code is written in python.
- We can edit the tablet information like adding a tablet, deleting a tablet and also the list of available tablets along with their costs can be shown.
- Bill information of a customer along with the tablets purchased also gets stored and can be viewed here. 
- This can be a very useful application for having a great organization of all medicines of a Pharmaceutical Stores and hence the project Pharm_S comes into picture.
